# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Completed Organization

### File Structure
- **Root**: Only `README.md` remains (main project readme)
- **docs/**: All user-facing documentation
- **docs/implementation/**: All implementation notes and status documents (55 files)

### Images
- ✅ `images/pong.png` - Pong game screenshot
- ✅ `images/SpaceInvaders.png` - Space Invaders game screenshot  
- ✅ `images/logo.png` - CyberBasic logo

### README.md Updates
- ✅ Added Space Invaders image reference
- ✅ All links point to `docs/` folder
- ✅ Both game images displayed in Examples section

### Documentation Organization
- ✅ User guides in `docs/` root
- ✅ Implementation notes in `docs/implementation/`
- ✅ Created `docs/README.md` for documentation overview
- ✅ Created `docs/implementation/README.md` for implementation docs

## Removed Files
- `API.MD` - Problematic filename
- `BASIC Language.md` - Problematic filename
- Duplicate `docs/FINAL_STATUS.md` (kept in implementation folder)

## Link Status
All documentation links in README.md and docs/ files are correct and point to:
- `docs/FILENAME.md` for user guides
- `docs/implementation/FILENAME.md` for implementation notes

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Review and potentially archive very old implementation notes
- Consider consolidating similar status documents
- Update any external links if needed

**Documentation is now well-organized and all links are working!** 📚
