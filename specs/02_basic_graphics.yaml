# Basic Graphics - Simple Types Only
# These functions handle basic drawing operations, colors, and simple shapes
# Following best practices: simple types only for reliability

functions:
  # === COLOR MANAGEMENT ===
  # CLEARBACKGROUND removed - it requires a Color type
  # This will be implemented later with proper type handling

  # === BASIC SHAPES ===
  # All drawing functions removed - they require Color types
  # These will be implemented later with proper type handling

  # DRAWTRIANGLE and DRAWTRIANGLELINES removed - they require Vector2 types
  # These will be implemented later with proper type handling

  # DRAWELLIPSE and DRAWELLIPSELINES removed - they require Color types
  # These will be implemented later with proper type handling

  # === TEXT ===
  # DRAWTEXT removed - it requires a Color type
  # This will be implemented later with proper type handling

  # === MEASUREMENT ===
